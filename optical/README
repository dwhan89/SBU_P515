This folder contains Optical Pumping Experiement related information.

TODO -- krw:
1) put error bars on magnetic moment plot
     - deltaE error bars DONE
     - B_{app} error bars NEEDED
2) hyperfine splitting spectrum plot
3) error bars onto cross section plot

TODO -- dw: 
2) doublecheck Maxwell coils dimensions and the number of turns of each coil
3) calculate the resonance frequnecy in high B field limit

Note:
1. The B-field per unit current on Niv et al. report is incorrect. The first and the third terms on RHS
   should be devided by 2

TODO -- both:
1) WRITE!!!
