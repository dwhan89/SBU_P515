TODO -- krw:
1) incorporate functionality into resonance-fit.py to write (append) fit 
   peak parameter to a file, and write script to read that file [done Feb. 11]
	*NOTE: can easily be editted to include the corresponding applied B-field
	       for the magnetic moment measurement (delta(E) vs. B_applied slope)

TODO -- dw: 
1) calculation of applied B-field as a function of current pushed through Maxwell coils [done Feb 11th]
2) doublecheck Maxwell coils dimensions and the number of turns of each coil
3) calculate the resonance frequnecy in high B field limit

Note:
1. The B-field per unit current on Niv et al. report is incorrect. The first and the third terms on RHS
   should be devided by 2
