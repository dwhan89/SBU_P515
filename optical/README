TODO -- krw: incorporate functionality into resonance-fit.py to write (append) fit 
peak parameter to a file, along with the corresponding applied B-field

TODO -- dw: 
1) calculation of applied B-field as a function of current pushed through Maxwell coils [done Feb 11th]
2) doublecheck Maxwell coils dimensions and the number of turns of each coil
3) calculate the resonance frequnecy in high B field limit

Note:
1. The B-field per unit current on Niv et al. report is incorrect. The first and the third terms on RHS
   should be devided by 2
