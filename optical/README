TODO -- krw:
1) incorporate functionality into resonance-fit.py to write (append) fit 
   peak parameter to a file, and write script to read that file [done Feb. 11]
	*NOTE: can easily be editted to include the corresponding applied B-field
	       for the magnetic moment measurement (delta(E) vs. B_applied slope)

TODO -- dw: 
1) calculation of applied B-field as a function of current pushed through Maxwell coils [done Feb 11th]
2) doublecheck Maxwell coils dimensions and the number of turns of each coil
3) calculate the resonance frequnecy in high B field limit

Note:
1. The B-field per unit current on Niv et al. report is incorrect. The first and the third terms on RHS
   should be devided by 2

TODO -- both:
1) Write! By Feb. 14 we should have all the data and plots (analysis code is
   already written) we need for the following measurements:
	- Absorption cross section
	- Ambient field
	- Magnetic moment (Can we pull apart different g-factors from this?
          Maybe by considering the magnetic moments of both 85Rb and 87Rb?)
   We should try and write up a "minireport" about these measurements by Fri. Feb. 17.
   This will be the beginning of the full report.
