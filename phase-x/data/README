Desctription of measurements

Note: 
theta_o   : initial phase after calibrating for parasitic capacitance
V_in      : input voltage from lock-in amp
theta_ext : additional phase such manually applied in order to display the out-of-phase component on the output channel 1
    
            theta_true = theta_measured - (theta_o + theta_ext)

Run 1 (April 11th 2017)

#Lock-in Amp Setting

theta_o = 0.17 deg
f       = 25 KHz
V_in    = 1 V

#Temp Source Setting
V_heat  = 48 V (w/ thermal lid )
V_cool  = 12 V (w/o thermal lid)

### Run 1 (April 18th 2017) ###

Note: we are measuring the absolute maginitude. 
In order to recover the true value, you should flip the sign 

# Lock-in Amp Setting
theta_o   = 0.09 deg
theta_ext = -90.0 deg
f         = 10 kHz
V_in      = 2V
R         = 1050 ohm

# Temp Source Setting
V_heat  = 48 V (w/ thermal lid )
V_cool  = 12 V (w/o thermal lid) 


### Run 2 (April 20th 2017) ###

Note:
- LabView software we are using has a problem registering input smaller than 0.1V  
  We had to apply the manual off-set to make it work.  substract 0.7V from our measumrents
- Like Run1, we need to flip sign to get the true measurements

# Lock-in Amp Setting
theta_o   = 0.09 deg
theta_ext = -90.0 deg
f         = 10 kHz
V_in      = 1V
R         = 1050 ohm

# Temp Source Setting
V_heat  = 48 V (w/ thermal lid )
V_cool  = 12 V (w/o thermal lid)
